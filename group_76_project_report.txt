COMMENTS ON DEMO: 

We loved this project! Touch grass is a nice name ... but ironic, eh?  Is a simulation of touching grass more effective than heading into the back yard?

Front end is lovely; lots of logic there.  Look at MVVM pattern as alternative to MVC.  Factory appropriate for grasses, color changing feature is excellent, and gen Z mode made us laugh.  Interesting in that this is maybe an accessibility feature of sorts!  Note that there are inherent tradeoffs in accessibility engineering; features that make software accessible to some can be inaccessible to others. 

Runa suggests looking at audiogames.net for examples of 3D sound games, as there are some minesweeper examples out there.

Group worked great together; the project turned out super well!

**Thank you for the Live Demo!**

PROCESS MARKS (40%)
